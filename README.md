# liri-node-app
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.


This is just like Siri for iphone but no voice command.
Instead we use the command line to get the information we want back from spotify, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies

# npm init -y &mdash
this will initialize a package.json file for this project. The package.json file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If I did not initialize npm init -y &mdash, it would be almost impossible for anyone to run this code

# gitignore file
This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.

```
node_modules
.DS_Store
.env
```

# .env file
This file will be used by the `dotenv` package to set what are known as environment variables to the global `process.env` object in node. These are values that are meant to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since we are gitignoring this file, they won't be pushed to github &mdash; keeping our API key information private.

* If someone wanted to clone your app from github and run it themselves, they would need to supply their own `.env` file for it to work.

# random.txt 
this connects with the do-what-it-says command

# What Each Command Should Do

1. `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`

   * This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API (`"https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "/events?app_id=codingbootcamp"`) for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

     * Name of the venue

     * Venue location

     * Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

   * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

     * Artist(s)

     * The song's name

     * A preview link of the song from Spotify

     * The album that the song is from

   * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

   
3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
     ```

  4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`

   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.

     * Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.
